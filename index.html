        <p>It's easy to see how learning online may be beneficial, with features such as self-paced learning, comfort, and cost. A student can meet and talk with other students and teachers through our portal for educational information and tools. It's also a great tool for both the student and the teacher to keep track of student progress.</p>

    <section class="why-PP">
        <h1>Why Us?</h1>
        <p>When a student joins our platform, we give a function that automatically marks and saves their attendance. The teacher must decide at what percentage of total class time a student's attendance will be marked as present. Students will be marked as present only if they have attended class up to that percent of class time.
